##Known Issues

This is a public beta. there are some issues I'm working on and also some limitations:

* the script doesn't work too well on very slow connections
* watch out for missing glyphs! (especially when a site uses icon web fonts such as [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/))
* the script will not replace text that has been inserted as an image :-)

##Changelog

* **0.0.1** First release.
